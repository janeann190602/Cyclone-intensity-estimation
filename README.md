# Cyclone-intensity-estimation
The aim of this project is to build a user-friendly and interactive dashboard which will directly procure the real time data from the satellite and do real time prediction of the intensity level of the upcoming cyclones in future. The developed CNN model to calculate the cyclone intensity is integrated with the front-end in order to produce a fully developed prototype. The future work of the project includes improving the accuracy and introducing more features to extend the model to an extensive one. To integrate this project use anaconda IDE for execution and posgresql for database.
